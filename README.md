If you've already created the entire project structure with all the files, let's approach coding one file at a time in a logical sequence. Here's the order I recommend:

1. **Start with `app/config.py`**
   - This establishes your base configuration
   - Other files will depend on these settings

2. **Next, create `app/templates/base.html`**
   - This is the foundation template that all pages will extend

3. **Then, implement `app/templates/components/head.html`**
   - Contains all your meta tags, CSS links, and other head elements
   - Referenced by your base.html

4. **Move to `app/templates/components/header.html`**
   - Navigation is a critical component of your site

5. **Implement `app/templates/components/footer.html`**
   - Complete the main structure of the site

6. **Then create `app/main.py`**
   - Set up your FastAPI application
   - Configure static files and templating

7. **Next, implement `app/routes/pages.py`**
   - Create the route handlers that will render your templates

8. **Create `app/templates/index.html`**
   - This will include all your section components

9. **Start implementing section files one by one**:
   - `app/templates/sections/hero.html` (start with this as it's the first visible section)
   - `app/templates/sections/why_python.html`
   - Continue with other sections in order of appearance

10. **Add JavaScript files as needed** for each interactive component
    - `app/static/js/main.js`
    - `app/static/js/navigation.js`
    - Other component-specific JS files

This approach allows you to build the site incrementally, starting with the structural components and then adding content sections. You'll be able to see progress at each step by running the application and viewing it in your browser.

After completing each file, run your application with `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` to see your changes and ensure everything is working correctly.
